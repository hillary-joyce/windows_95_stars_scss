# Windows 95 Star Screensaver
[Check it Out](https://hillary-joyce.github.io/windows_stars_css/)
In the age of reboots, I felt it was time for the most classic screensaver of all time to get it's own gritty remake.
This is my attempt to re-create the classic Windows 95 stars screensaver using css animations &amp; sass

## But Why?
I'm learning Sass and CSS animations, and wanted a simple project to play around with the principles of both and get comfortable writing code.

## Next Steps
Defintely would've been easier and cleaner with JS, so maybe that's my next project. The world can never have too many star screensavers.
